# The Odin Project Solutions

## About This Repo

I came across The Odin Project (TOP) in late 2023 and decided to learn about front end stuff in my spare time. This repo contains my solutions to some of the project assignments in TOP.

## Projects

### Rock Paper Scissors

At first I made a very simple page that met the requirements, but then I wanted to try a few things and turn it into something slightly more complicated. Mainly I wanted to turn it into more like an acutal 'game', with a game menu and an achievement system.

Current version:
- The game is fully working. Game menu and achievement system added. 

To Do (If I have the time and motivation):
- Check css to support different viewport size.

### Calculator

The main objective is to recreate the calculator application that is found on my OnePlus 6T phone (OxygenOS Version 11.1.2.2) with some minor improvements, such as preventing users from inputting obvious bad expressions, like 5.+%.5%.

Current version:
- The basic version is complete. It has all the functionalities as the phone app in basic mode, plus the ability to prevent bad expressions from being entered.

To Do (If I have the time and motivation):
- Check css for different viewport size.
- Rewrite the codes that check if the expressions are valid for scalabilty and readability.
- Add scientific calculator mode.
